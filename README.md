# Fundamentals of Informatics: Cleaning a Dataset
This repository contains the first practice of the Fundamentals of Informatics course (2022-23), which involves cleaning a dataset.

## Project Description
The goal of this practice is to learn how to handle and clean datasets using Shell scripts. Several CSV files with movie and show data have been provided, and scripts have been created to filter and clean this data, generating final files that are more manageable and useful for further analysis.

## Repository Contents
- **Movies.csv**: Original file with movie data.
- **Movies_columna12.csv** to **Movies_columna16.csv**: Files with specific columns extracted from the original dataset.
- **Movies_f.csv** and **Movies_net.csv**: Files with filtered and cleaned movie data.
- **Shows.csv**: Original file with show data.
- **Shows_columna12.csv** to **Shows_columna15.csv**: Files with specific columns extracted from the original dataset.
- **Shows_f.csv** and **Shows_net.csv**: Files with filtered and cleaned show data.
- **practica1.sh**: Script used for data cleaning and processing.
- **prova.txt** and **prova_script_pas4**: Test files used during the development of the practice.
- **titles.cvs**: File with titles of movies and shows.
